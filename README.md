# Anagram Generator

The aim of this project is to build a simple anagram generator as a learning oportunity. It should have a fairly good 
and easy to use GUI and implement some fairly advanced algoritms.

## Getting Started

The repository consists of the source files for a java project using gradle. This was set up in intellij IDEA.
There is a 0.1 release available, but it's incomplete and may be buggy.
No javadoc yet.

### Prerequisites

On this project openjdk-14 and javafx 14 have been used.
The releases contain a custom jre image so no jre is required.

### Installing

Download or clone the repository and compile it with your favourite tool. I have used the intellij with gradle.
Alternatively, every release has a portable version and an installer.


## Built With

* [openjdk-14](https://jdk.java.net/14/) - The java standard used
* [javafx](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) - javafx libray for GUI
* [Factorial generator used](https://sudonull.com/post/72637-Fast-Factorial-Computation-PrimeSwing) - Used to calculate factorial of numbers to predict the number of anagrams
